*pypyr*
    pronounce how you like, but I generally say *piper* as in "piping down the
    valleys wild"


pypyr is a command line interface to run pipelines defined in yaml. Think of
pypyr as a simple task runner that lets you run sequential steps.

Installation
============

pip
---
.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install --upgrade pypyr

Python version
--------------
Tested against Python 3.6

Usage
=====
Run your first pipeline
-----------------------
Run one of the built-in pipelines to get a feel for it:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pypyr --name echo --context "echoMe=Ceci n'est pas une pipe" --log 20

You can achieve the same thing by running a pipeline where the context is set
in the pipeline yaml rather than as a --context argument:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pypyr --name magritte --log 20


Run a pipeline
--------------
pypyr assumes a pipelines directory in your current working directory.

.. code-block:: bash

  # run pipelines/mypipelinename.yaml with DEBUG logging level
  $ pypyr --name mypipelinename

  # run pipelines/mypipelinename.yaml with INFO logging level
  $ pypyr --name pipelinename --log 20

  # run pipelines/mypipelinename.yaml with an input context. For this input to
  # be available to your pipeline you need to specify a context_parser on your
  # pipeline.
  $ pypyr --name pipelinename --context 'mykey=value'

Get cli help
------------
pypyr has a couple of arguments and switches you might find useful. See them all
here:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pypyr -h

Anatomy of a pypyr pipeline
===========================
Pipeline yaml structure
-----------------------
A pipeline is a .yaml file. Save pipelines to a `pipelines` directory in your
working directory.

  .. code-block:: yaml

    # This is an example showing the anatomy of a pypyr pipeline
    # A pipeline should be saved as {working dir}/pipelines/mypipelinename.yaml.
    # Run the pipeline from {working dir} like this: pypyr --name mypipelinename

    # optional
    context_parser: my.custom.parser

    # mandatory.
    steps:
      - my.package.my.module # simple step pointing at a python module in a package
      - mymodule # simple step pointing at a python file
      - name: my.package.another.module # complex step. It contains a description and in parameters.
        description: Optional description is for humans. It's any text that makes your life easier.
        in: #optional. In parameters are added to the context so that this step and subsequent steps can use these key-value pairs.
          parameter1: value1
          parameter2: value2

    # optional.
    on_success:
      - my.first.success.step
      - my.second.success.step

    # optional.
    on_failure:
      - my.failure.handler.step
      - my.failure.handler.notifier

+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

context_parser
--------------
Optional.

A context_parser parses the pypyr --context input argument. The chances are
pretty good that it will take the --context argument and put in into the pypyr
context.

The pypyr context is a dictionary that is in scope for the duration of the entire
pipeline. The context_parser can initialize the context. Any step in the pipeline
can add, edit or remove items from the context dictionary.

Built-in context parsers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **context parser**          | **description**                                 | **example input**                                                                   |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| pypyr.context.commas        | Takes a comma delimited string and returns a    |`pypyr --name pipelinename --context "param1,param2,param3"`                         |

|                             | with value to true.                             |This will create a context dictionary like this:                                     |
|                             |                                                 |{'param1': True, 'param2': True, 'param3': True}                                     |

Roll your own context_parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  .. code-block:: python

    import pypyr.log.logger

    # use pypyr logger to ensure loglevel is set correctly and logs are formatted nicely
    logger = pypyr.log.logger.get_logger(__name__)


    def get_parsed_context(context_arg):
        """This is the signature for a context parser. Input context is the string received from pypyr --context 'value here'"""
        assert context_arg, ("pipeline must be invoked with --context set.")
        logger.debug("starting")

        # your clever code here. Chances are pretty good you'll be doing things with the input context string to create a dictionary.

        # function signature returns a dictionary
        return {'key1': 'value1', 'key2':'value2'}

steps
-----
Mandatory.

steps is a list of steps to execute in sequence. A step is simply a bit of
python that does stuff.

You can specify a step in the pipeline yaml in two ways:
  * Simple step

    - a simple step is just the name of the python module.

    - pypyr will look in your working directory for these modules or packages.

    - For a package, be sure to specify the full namespace (i.e not just `mymodule`, but `mypackage.mymodule`).

      .. code-block:: yaml

        steps:
          - my.package.my.module # points at a python module in a package.
          - mymodule # simple step pointing at a python file

  * Complex step

    - a complex step allows you to specify a few more details for your step, but at heart it's the same thing as a simple step - it points at some python.

      .. code-block:: yaml

        steps:
          - name: my.package.another.module
            description: Optional Description is for humans. It's any yaml-escaped text that makes your life easier.
            in: #optional. In parameters are added to the context so that this step and subsequent steps can use these key-value pairs.
              parameter1: value1
              parameter2: value2


  * You can freely mix and match simple and complex steps in the same pipeline.

  * Frankly, the only reason simple steps are there is because I'm lazy and I dislike redundant typing.


Built-in steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pypyr.steps.contextset
``````````````````````
Sets context values from already existing context values.

This is handy if you need to prepare certain keys in context where a next step
might need a specific key. If you already have the value in context, you can
create a new key (or update existing key) with that value.

So let's say you already have `context['currentKey'] = 'eggs'`.
If you run newKey: currentKey, you'll end up with `context['newKey'] == 'eggs'`

For example, say your context looks like this,

  .. code-block:: yaml

        key1: value1
        key2: value2
        key3: value3

and your pipeline yaml looks like this:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    steps:
      - name: pypyr.steps.contextset
        in:
          contextSet:
            key2: key1
            key4: key3

This will result in context like this:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      key1: value1
      key2: value1
      key3: value3
      key4: value3

pypyr.steps.echo
````````````````
Echo the context value `echoMe` to the output.

For example, if you had pipelines/mypipeline.yaml like this:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    context_parser: pypyr.context.keyvaluepairs
    steps:
      - name: pypyr.steps.echo

You can run:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pypyr --name mypipeline --context 'echoMe=test test test'


Alternatively, if you had pipelines/look-ma-no-params.yaml like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  steps:
    - name: pypyr.steps.echo
      description: Output echoMe
      in:
        echoMe: Ceci n'est pas une pipe


You can run:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ pypyr --name look-ma-no-params --log 20

pypyr.steps.py
``````````````
Executes the context value `pycode` as python code.

Will exec context['pycode'] as a dynamically interpreted python code block.

You can access and change the context dictionary in a py step. See a worked
example here:
https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr-example/tree/master/pipelines/py.yaml

For example, this will invoke python print and print 2:

.. code-block:: yaml

  steps:
    - name: pypyr.steps.py
      description: Example of an arb python command. Will print 2.
      in:
        pycode: print(1+1)

pypyr.steps.pypyrversion
````````````````````````
Outputs the same as:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pypyr --version

This is an actual pipeline, though, so unlike --version, it'll use the standard
pypyr logging format.

Example pipeline yaml:

  .. code-block:: bash

      steps:
        - pypyr.steps.pypyrversion

pypyr.steps.safeshell
`````````````````````
Runs the context value `cmd` in the default shell. On a sensible O/S, this is
`/bin/sh`

In `safeshell`, you cannot use things like exit, return, shell pipes, filename
wildcards, environment variable expansion, and expansion of ~ to a user’s
home directory.

Example pipeline yaml:

  .. code-block:: bash

    steps:
      - name: pypyr.steps.safeshell
        in:
          cmd: ls -a

pypyr.steps.shell
`````````````````````
Runs the context value `cmd` in the default shell.

Do all the things you can't do with `safeshell`.

Example pipeline yaml using a pipe:

  .. code-block:: bash

    steps:
      - name: pypyr.steps.shell
        in:
          cmd: ls | grep pipe; echo if you had something pipey it should show up;

Roll your own step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: python

  import pypyr.log.logger


  # use pypyr logger to ensure loglevel is set correctly and logs are formatted
  # nicely. this gets a python logging.Logger type - so you can .warning,
  # .error et.
  logger = pypyr.log.logger.get_logger(__name__)


  def run_step(context):
      """Run code in here. This shows you how to code a custom pipeline step.

      :param context: dictionary-like type
      """
      logger.debug("started")
      # you probably want to do some asserts here to check that the input context
      # dictionary contains the keys and values you need for your code to work.
      assert 'mykeyvalue' in context, ("context['mykeyvalue'] must exist for my clever step.")

      # it's good form only to use .info and higher log levels when you must.
      # For .debug() being verbose is very much encouraged.
      logger.info("Your clever code goes here. . . ")

      # Add or edit context items. These are available to any pipeline steps
      # following this one.
      context['existingkey'] = 'new value overwrites old value'
      context['mynewcleverkey'] = 'new value'

      logger.debug("done")

on_success
----------
on_success is a list of steps to execute in sequence. Runs when `steps:`
completes successfully.

You can use built-in steps or code your own steps exactly like you would for
steps - it uses the same function signature.

on_failure
----------
on_failure is a list of steps to execute in sequence. Runs when any of the
above hits an unhandled exception.

If on_failure encounters another exception while processing an exception, then
both that exception and the original cause exception will be logged.

You can use built-in steps or code your own steps exactly like you would for
steps - it uses the same function signature.

Testing (for pypyr-cli developers)
==================================
Testing without worrying about dependencies
-------------------------------------------
Run tox to test the packaging cycle inside a virtual env, plus run all tests:

  .. code-block:: bash

    # just run tests
    $ tox -e dev -- tests
    # run tests, validate README.rst, run flake8 linter
    $ tox -e stage -- tests

If tox takes too long
---------------------
The test framework is pytest. If you only want to run tests:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install -e .[dev,test]

Day-to-day testing
------------------
- Tests live under */tests* (surprising, eh?). Mirror the directory structure of
  the code being tested.
- Prefix a test definition with *test_* - so a unit test looks like

  .. code-block:: python

    def test_this_should_totally_work():

- To execute tests, from root directory:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests

- For a bit more info on running tests:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pytest --verbose [path]

- To execute a specific test module:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests/unit/arb_test_file.py

Contribute
==========
Bugs
----
Well, you know. No one's perfect. Feel free to `create an issue
<https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr-cli/issues/new>`_.

Contribute to the core cli
--------------------------
The usual jazz - create an issue, fork, code, test, PR. It might be an idea to
discuss your idea via the Issues list first before you go off and write a
huge amount of code - you never know, something might already be in the works,
or maybe it's not quite right for the core-cli (you're still welcome to fork
and go wild regardless, of course, it just mighn't get merged back in here).

Plug-Ins
--------
You've probably noticed by now that pypyr is built to be pretty extensible.
You've probably also noticed that the core pypyr cli is deliberately kept light.
The core cli is philosophically only a way of running a sequence of steps.
Dependencies to external libraries should generally get their own package, so
end-users can selectively install what they need rather than have a monolithic
batteries-included application.

If you've got some custom context_parser or steps code that are useful, create a
repo and bask in the glow of sharing with the open source community. Honor the
pypyr Apache license please.

I generally name plug-ins `pypyr-myplugin`, where myplugin is likely some sort
of dependency that you don't want in the pypyr core cli. For example,
`pypyr-aws` contains pypyr-steps for the AWS boto3 library. This is kept separate
so that you don't have to deal with yet another dependency you don't need if your
current project isn't using AWS.

If you want your plug-in listed here for official cred, please get in touch via
the Issues list. Get in touch anyway, would love to hear from you at
https://www.345.systems/contact.
