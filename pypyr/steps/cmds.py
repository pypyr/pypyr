def run_step(context):
    """Run commands, programs or executables asynchronously, in parallel.

    Context is a pypyr.context.Context. This is dict-like.

    Context must contain the following keys:
        cmds:
            - <<cmd string 1>>
            - <<cmd string 2>>

    where <<cmd string>> is command + args to execute.

    You can alternatively use the expanded syntax to override default options:

    cmds:
        run: list[str | list[str]]. mandatory. command + args to execute.
            If list entry is another list[str], the sub-list will run in
            serial.
        save: bool. defaults False. save output to cmdOut. Treats output
            as text in the system's encoding and removes newlines at end.
        cwd: str/Pathlike. optional. Working directory for these commands.
        bytes (bool): Default False. When `save` return output bytes from
            cmds unaltered, without applying any encoding & text newline
            processing.
        encoding (str): Default None. When `save`, decode output with
            this encoding. The default of None uses the system encoding and
            should "just work".
        stdout (str | Path): Default None. Write stdout to this file path.
            Special value `/dev/null` writes to the system null device.
        stderr (str | Path): Default None. Write stderr to this file path.
            Special value `/dev/null` writes to the system null device.
            Special value `/dev/stdout` redirects err output to stdout.
        append (bool): Default False. When stdout/stderr a file, append
            rather than overwrite. Default is to overwrite.

    In expanded syntax, `run` can be a simple string or a list:
        cmds:
          run:
            - ./my-executable --arg
            - ./another-executable --arg
          save: False
          cwd: ./path/here

    Will execute the command string in the shell as a sub-process.
    Escape curly braces: if you want a literal curly brace, double it like
    {{ or }}.

    If save is True, will save the output as a list of results in the order
    executed. Each result is a pypyr.subproc.SubprocessResult, with the schema:
    cmd: the cmd/args executed
    returncode: 0
    stdout: 'stdout str here. None if empty.'
    stderr: 'stderr str here. None if empty.'

    cmdOut.returncode is the exit status of the called process. Typically 0
    means OK. A negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated by
    signal N (POSIX only).

    If the sub-process couldn't spawn at all (e.g executable not found), the
    results list will contain the Exception object instead of a
    SubprocessResult.

    You can find this list of results in context `cmdOut` after step completes.

    context['cmds'] will interpolate anything in curly braces for values
    found in context. So if your context looks like this:
        key1: value1
        key2: value2
        cmds:
            - mything --arg1 {key1}

    The cmd passed to the shell will be "mything --arg value1"
